# 📚 Book App

A simple React project for displaying and managing books.  
This app was built to practice React components, props, and basic UI design.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
This project helped me learn how to:
- Build reusable components in React  
- Manage data using props and state  
- Work with layouts and modular structure  
- Style components using CSS modules  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **React** (with Vite)
- **CSS Modules**
- **Lucide Icons**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**

---

## 🧠 What I Built
In this project I created:
- **BookCard Component:** shows book details like title, author, image, and language.  
- **Footer Component:** simple layout footer for the page.  
- **Search Section (planned):** where users can search books.  
- **App Layout:** connects all components and renders book data.
